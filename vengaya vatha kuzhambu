Qty.
 - Onion (1 cup) 
 - Toor dal (2 tsp)
 - Red chilies (5)
 - Sambar powder
 - Curry leaves
 - Jaggery
 - Fenugreek seeds (vendhayam) 
 - Tamarind 

Instructions.
1. Soak a fist-sized block of tamarind pulp in 2 cups of hot water. Then, add 2 more cups of hot water. (If using paste, use 1 spoon of it.
As a general rule, dilute one part concentrate with two parts water.)

2. Heat sesame oil in a heavy bottomed pan. Add the mustard seeds. After they have popped, add the toor dal, red chilies and vendhayam. Fry
for about 15 seconds.

3. Add the onions. Saute for 2-3 minutes.

4. Add the sambar powder (3 spoons), tamarind, salt and curry leaves. Add water (if low) and bring to a boil. Simmer for 15-20 minutes.

5. Add the jaggery. If the kuzhambu is not thick enough, wait for it to reduce, or add a rice flour emulsion.
