Szechuan chutney

Tadka:
Oil, onion and (a lot of) chili (very nicely cut). Can use the chopper for this. 

Add onion and chili together. Then add carrot, and then capsicum. Then some szechuan chutney sauce, some hot sauce, and add ketchup and soy
sauce. Add one spoon vinegar if you have. Add salt as required. Add basmati rice to this (80% cooked). 

1 cup rice to 2-2.5 cup salt.
